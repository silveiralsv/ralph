## US-001 - 2026-01-27 18:38:42
Status: PASSED
Summary: Implemented resolve_script_path function that follows symlinks to find the actual script location. Works on macOS (which lacks readlink -f) and Linux by manually resolving symlinks in a loop.
Commit: 807255b

## US-002 - 2026-01-27 18:40:15
Status: PASSED
Summary: Updated help text in print_usage function to show 'ralph' instead of 'ralph.sh', updated examples to use 'ralph' command, and updated description to reflect running from any project directory.

## US-003 - 2026-01-27 18:41:30
Status: PASSED
Summary: Created install.sh script that creates a symlink at /usr/local/bin/ralph. Features automatic sudo detection, idempotent operation (safe to run multiple times), --uninstall flag, and verification of successful installation.

## US-004 - 2026-01-27 18:44:04
Status: PASSED
Summary: Verified end-to-end functionality by testing all flags (--help, --max, -m, positional args) via symlink from a different directory. Confirmed SCRIPT_DIR resolution correctly follows symlinks to find CLAUDE.md and PROJECT_DIR correctly uses the current working directory. Error handling verified when prd.json is missing.
